  caveats <<~EOS
    bxplore is signed ad hoc but not notarized by Apple, so macOS blocks both the
    app and the `bxplore` command until you allow it once: open bxplore.app with
    right click, Open (or allow it in System Settings, Privacy & Security), or run
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "#{appdir}/bxplore.app"
  EOS
